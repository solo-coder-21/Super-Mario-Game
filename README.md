Tkinter Mario-Style Platformer

This is a classic platformer game, inspired by Super Mario Bros., built entirely in Python using the standard tkinter library. All graphics are drawn procedurally using the Tkinter canvas, meaning no external images or assets are required!

It serves as a demonstration of how to build a complete game with physics, collisions, enemies, and power-ups using only standard Python libraries.

(After you run the program, take a screenshot, upload it to your repository, and replace this text with the image link)
